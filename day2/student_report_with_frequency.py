# A teacher is in the process of generating few reports based on the marks scored by the students of her class in a
# project in assessment.

# 1. find_more_than_average(): Find and return the percentage of students who have scored more than the average 
# mark of the class.OverflowError
# 2. generate_frequency() : find how many students have scored the same works. The results should be populated in a 
# listand returned.
# 3. sort_marks() : Sort the marks in the increasing order from 0 to 25. The sorted values should be populated in a
# list and returned
